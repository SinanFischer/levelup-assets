## 🔒 Why the source code is not public

LevelUp is **not open source**.

The extension is built on an **innovative, first-mover system** that turns coding activity into a game-like experience.  
It’s a concept I designed from the ground up, aiming to make coding both productive and genuinely rewarding.  
To protect this idea and prevent early copies, the source code remains closed.

My focus is on delivering a **secure, local-only, and privacy-friendly** experience.  
There are **no external servers**, **no analytics**, and **no data sharing**. Everything happens directly on your device.  
(Online features like leaderboards may be added later, with transparency in mind.)
